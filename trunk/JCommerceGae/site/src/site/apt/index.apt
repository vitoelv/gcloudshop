Introduction

   This project is a migration of classic independent shop application ECShop (based on LAMP) to Google's cloud computing platform: Google AppEngine.   
   
   The name "gcShop" stands for:
   
      * "google cloud shop" system.
      
      * yet another "ecShop" just as "gPhone" over "iPhone".
